# About

Sliding puzzles are a form of combination puzzles which requires the player to move puzzle pieces on a 2-dimensional plane to establish a certain final configuration.

Typically the final configuration is established with the bottom-right piece of the puzzle missing.

<br>

> Fun fact: These puzzles are also sometimes known as *'8-puzzles'* or *'15-puzzles'*, since they are usually a square grid [e.g. (3x3) or (4x4)] with the last tile missing.

# How to play
